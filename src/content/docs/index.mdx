# Welcome to Aeraelyr's hideout
I am Aeraelyr the Brass Dragon. This is the story of the town of Brassscale where I grew up.
Everything there went great! I had everything I wanted, until some adventures showed up who
decided I was destabilizing the region. They, of course, had no idea what they were talking
about. They had no idea of the scale on which I was operating, even back then!
